The next instructions are meant to run the ruby on rails project ./worker_api/
as a development in a Debian/Ubuntu OS with a MySQL database:

Updates the system:
  sudo apt update

Install rvm with:
  gpg --keyserver  hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ --recv-keys 409B6B 1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails

Download the gems with:
  cd ./worker_api
  bundle install

You will need edit the ./worker_api/config/database.yml username and password or
you can create that user in the database server.

Now prepare the database configuration and data with this command:
  rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

Finally, you can run the project with:
  rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 6428
